# timetracker
An easy to use time tracker using data on a SharePoint 2013.

# What you need first
Before we can start deploying and using the plugin, there are some things we must take care for:

* setup a SharePoint 2013 server with the appropriate list structure and authentication scheme
* create a Github organization and an access token

Before going into details of SharePoint we will install the plug-in first.

# Installation
Open Chrome and head to the menu. Select More Tools-->Extensions to open the Google Chrome extension area. Drag and drop the extension file (SPTimeTracker.crx) to the window and have it installed.
